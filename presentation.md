#What is a HipHopVM?


##Background
 - HipHopVM is an Free and Open Source PHP engine
 - Written primarily in C++ with moderate amounts of PHP and x86_64 assembly
 - It uses a JIT compiler (though historically was a PHP to C++ transpiler)
 - It is the PHP engine designed by and which hosts Facebook
 - Its on GitHub! [https://github.com/facebook/hhvm][hhvm_github]


##Our Tasks
 - To isolate the affect of na√Øve reference counting on HHVM's performance
 - JAN
 - NATHAN

----------------------

Before continuing we will briefly introduce some relevant concepts

#Internals of HHVM

##Reference Counting in the PHP language
 - Based on explicit garbage collection (reference counting)
 - Required by language semantics
 - PHP is **pass by value**
 - Pass by value can be slow due to large amount of copies (especially with large arrays)
 

-----------------------

 - Solution: Copy on Write!
 - Problem: Need to know current reference count
 - Each mutation requires immediate increment and decrement of reference counts
 - Advantage: Immediate garbage reclamation
 - **This requirement will cause us major problems shortly**
 

##Reference Counting in HHVM (C++)
 - Reference counted objects have an `int_32t m_count` field and call a macro in [countable.h][countable.h] containing various reference counting operations (`incRefCont()`, `hasMultipleRefs()`, `decRefAndRelease()` etc)
 - Not consistently used (certain places directly mutate `m_count` or define separate ref-counting methods)
 - Difficult to track down all mutations of `m_count`

##Reference Counting in HHVM (JIT)
 - `int_32t m_count` at a common offset (12 bytes) in all refcounted objects
 - Several opcodes emit reference counting assembly via the JIT
 - Intermediate Representation is optimised to remove inc/dec pairs where safe to do so
 - Simpler to locate, more difficult to understand
 
--------------------
 
**Both these systems are implemented independent of each other (`m_count` and destructors shared) and the memory manager**
 
##Memory Management
 - MENTION REQUEST LOCAL ETC, REQUIRED FOR CONTEXT LATER ON

#Our Tasks

##HHVM Without Reference Counting
 - Who needs reference counts? (besides the PHP semantics)
 - If we are freeing our heap at the end of request, why do we need immediate reclamation?
 - Lets try nail down the performance penalty of immediate reference counting.

##Lets Modify HHVM 
Removed/Disabled 3 forms of reference counting to create [hhvmnocount][hhvmnocount]:
 
 - [countable.h][countable.h] functions
 - JIT emitted reference counting
 - Various manual mutations and re-implementations (this took a while)
 
 -----------------
 
 - Compared to regular HHVM, [hhvmnocount][hhvmnocount] was much slower
 - Completely different memory usage characteristics
 - Hand't yet isolated the effects of reference counting

##Continuos Allocation
In order to isolate the effects of reference counting a modified memory manager was used:

 - Memory Manager no longer freed memory, No longer used free lists
 - Large objects no longer special case
 - Memory not freed at requests end
 - Objects still _'sweeped'_ due to unreclaimed File and Database objects causing errors.
 
 -----------------
 
 - Resulted in the [hhvmbump][hhvmbump] and [hhvmbumpnocount][hhvmbumpnocount] branches.
 - Reference counting was now isolated, time to run some tests.
 
##Benchmark Setup
 - Due to the nature of the changes, it was difficult to find representative PHP packages that ran on all builds
 - A modified version of a benchmark included in HHVM ([center-of-mass.php][center-of-mass.php]) was chosen due to its heavy memory usage 
 - [center-of-mass.php][center-of-mass.php] is unlikely to represent the average PHP request but was the only test with sufficient memory usage for benchmarking
 
------------------ 

The configuration used for benchmarking:

 - Linux kernel version: 3.12.6-300.fc20.x86_64
 - CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
 - Memory: 4x4G DDR3 memory at 1600MHz (no swap partiton)
 - internal ssd for HHVM builds
 - Release configuration
 - Appache Benchmark (ab) with various levels of concurrency and test lengths
