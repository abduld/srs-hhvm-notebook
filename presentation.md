#What is a HipHopVM?


##Background
 - HipHopVM is an Free and Open Source PHP engine
 - Written primarily in C++ with moderate ammounts of PHP and x86_64 assembly
 - It uses a JIT compiler (though historically was a PHP to C++ transpiler)
 - It is the PHP engine designed by and which hosts Facebook
 - Its on GitHub! [https://github.com/facebook/hhvm][hhvm_github]


##Our Tasks
 - To isolate the affect of na√Øve reference counting on HHVM's performance
 - To observe how memory access maps to actual physical memory access
 - NATHAN

Before continuing we will briefly introduce some relevant concepts

#Our Tasks

##BEN TASK

##Physical Memory Profile
- Memory utilization
- Tool: Valgrind
  - Get Memory Sectors from HHVM
  - Monitor memory loads and stores from valgrind
  - Valgrind a little too powerful
- Future
